## What is the Fragment Engine?

The Fragment Engine is a modular game engine made for (platform) fighting games.

What does this mean ? This means that by itself, it does nothing, you need to add [Shards](#shards) to
make up a Gem (Pronounced [ɡeɪm])

## Shards?

Shards are community packages that make up a Gem, a shard can be anything from
characters, maps, game features, and other assets (At least that's the objective).

## Goals

- [ ] Modular: Anything can be added through Shards
- [ ] Capable: Fragment should be able to handle a large amount of Shards at once
- [ ] Stable: Changes to the engine shouldn't break Shards (at least not too often)
- [ ] Fast: Should run on every toaster that's capable of booting up
- [ ] Complete: Shards should be able to do *anything* in the game
